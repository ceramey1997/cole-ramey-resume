After two years at Southern Union, I transferred to Auburn University to finish my degree in Software Engineering. As a result of my transfer, I was able to be a part of a Co-op with ADTRAN in Huntsville, AL. My time at ADTRAN helped solidify my interest in software as well as strengthen my skills as a developer. I was able to work with many technologies, spanning from Python to OpenStack, as well as general testing and team collaboration with larger codebases.
